# corndocker 

## Description

This is a simple command line tool to manage docker-compose files. It is written in JS/Bun and is intended to be used as a global command line tool.
The central ideia is to provide a simple way to manage docker-compose files, storing then in a central place and allowing to run and stop services with a simple command.
To work, corndocker needs to be in PATH variable and docker-compose needs to be installed.
In dist folder you can find the compiled version of the code.
